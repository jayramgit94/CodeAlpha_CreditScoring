# Credit Scoring Model - CodeAlpha Project

## Objective
The goal of this project is to predict whether a person is creditworthy based on their financial and personal information using machine learning.

## Algorithms Used
We applied the following machine learning models:
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest Classifier

## Evaluation Metrics
To check how well the models perform, we used:
- Accuracy  
- F1-Score  
- ROC-AUC Score  
- Confusion Matrix

## Dataset
We used a dataset from Kaggle:  
[Credit Score Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parisrohan/credit-score-classification)

## Tools and Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook

## Results
The Random Forest Classifier achieved an ROC-AUC Score of **__%**  
(You can update this after running the model and getting the result.)
